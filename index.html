          Who among us, contemplating a more rapid climate change than the models
          predicted and witnessing declines among even common species, hasn't wished
          for a miracle? In the first half of Catton's novel we meet the idealists
          struggling to find answers and the billionaire who doesn't struggle at all
          to provide them seed funding. The collaboration and conflicts between
          characters who exist on opposite sides of social divides—one landed, wealthy,
          unprincipled, and old, the other visionary, young, idealistic, and landless—
          frame a world where the reader might hope for a tidy resolution. In the end,
          Catton reminds us that the answer may be no one.

          Might wonder how they were ever going to get out of this mess and who was
          going to be redeemed. In the end, Catton reminds us that the answer to that
          question may be no one.
